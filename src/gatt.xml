  <!-- BLETalk protocol:
       Allows low-latency transfer of audio data over BLE.
       Similar to most other voice-over-BLE protocols, but there is no standard
       so far so might as well use our own UUID.
       
       Each packet will contain arbitrary amount of audio data, sampled at
       12000 Hz and encoded using 4-bit ADPCM coding, such as in VOX format.
       The packet begins with two bytes that contain the current ADPCM step
       size (6 bits) and waveform value (10 bits), to keep decoder in sync even
       if some packets are lost.
       
       Client can send audio to the server using "Attribute write without
       response" operation. Server will send audio to the client using
       "Attribute notify" operation. Both of these are non-acknowledged,
       best-effort transfers.
